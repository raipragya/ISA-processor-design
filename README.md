# ISA-processor-design
--------------------------
This project centers on the design and implementation of an
Instructional Addressing System (IAS) processorâ€”an
instrumental computing architecture pioneered by John von
Neumann.
---------------------------
I have chosen to implement a program that takes n
elements, stores it as an array, and then returns the maximum
element of all the elements input in the array
----------------------------
Project details:
----------------------------
A C code for the above program is written. Next, it is converted to
assembly level language, using several instructions available in
the IAS instruction set as well as I have created some of my own instructions.
Next,a assembler is implemented in C++ which can read our
assembly level program. It generates a machine code which is given as input
to our processor(processor.cpp) to generate out the required result.
